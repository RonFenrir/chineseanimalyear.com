            Your Feng Shui element (${zodiacSign.element}) needs reinforcement this year. Consider adding ${zodiacSign.element.toLowerCase()} elements to the ${activities.favorable[zodiacSign.name][4].split(' ').pop().slice(0, -1)} area of your home, and avoid the colors associated with conflicting elements, particularly ${activities.unfavorable[zodiacSign.name][3].split(' ').pop()}.
